## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Media Queries: I learned how to use media queries to apply different styles based on the size of the viewport or device screen. This allowed me to create a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.

CSS Styling: I improved my CSS skills by applying styles to different elements such as text, images, and containers. This included setting colors, margins, padding, and font properties to create visually appealing content.

Image Styling: I discovered how to style images using CSS, including adjusting their size, adding borders, and applying filters or transformations.

Responsive Design: I gained knowledge about creating responsive designs that look good on various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This involved using relative units like percentages and media queries.


### Continued development

Here are some areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

Advanced CSS Techniques: While I have a good understanding of basic CSS properties and selectors, I want to explore more advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox, Grid Layout, CSS animations, and transitions. Mastering these techniques will allow me to create more complex and visually appealing layouts.

Responsive Design: I want to deepen my understanding of responsive design principles and best practices. This includes learning more about fluid layouts, responsive typography, and handling complex responsive scenarios to ensure consistent user experiences across different devices and screen sizes.

CSS Preprocessors: While I'm familiar with CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less, I want to gain more experience and proficiency in using them. These tools can significantly improve my productivity by allowing me to write cleaner and more maintainable CSS code with features like variables, mixins, and nesting.

Accessibility: I want to prioritize accessibility in my projects by ensuring that websites are usable and navigable for all users, including those with disabilities. This involves learning about accessibility standards, best practices for semantic HTML, proper use of ARIA roles and attributes, and conducting accessibility audits and testing.

CSS Architecture: I aim to improve my CSS architecture skills by adopting scalable and maintainable CSS methodologies like BEM (Block Element Modifier), SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS), or ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS). These methodologies help organize CSS codebases and make them easier to manage in larger projects.
